Check out the latest version of an assistant for Dota Auto Chess!

I created this tool to make it easier to visualize combos and gather more information about chess pieces outside of the game. You can add pieces to your squad from the *Chess Pieces* Section, view and remove pieces from *Current Squad*, and the combos you are currently getting will light up under *Species* and *Classes*.
