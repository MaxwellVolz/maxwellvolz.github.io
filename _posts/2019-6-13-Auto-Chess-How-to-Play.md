A Short Intro to Dota Auto Chess

Dota Auto Chess is a custom game for Dota. It is nothing like Dota. 

Players assemble a team of units to battle against each other in a series of rounds. Each round players add to their team while trying to find combinations of similar pieces **and** pieces with matching species and classes. 

After assembling chess pieces on their chess board they fight against either a set of neutral creeps for a chance at loot or copies of a random opponents team.

Basics:
 - Each player starts with 100% life
 - You lose life by losing rounds on your own board
 - Rounds consist of PVP and PVE battles
 - Draws and wins do not lead to losing life
 - Once a player reaches 0% they are eliminated
 - As you gain levels you can have more pieces in play
 - Combining 3 of the same piece will make it a ★★ piece
 - Combining 3 ★★ pieces will make it ★★★ piece, super saiyan mode

### You control everything in the game with a unit called a courier

The first three rounds are against tree creatures of increasing difficulty.

### PVE rounds are important to win because killing creatures in these rounds gives a chance to drop items.

Items appear as present boxes you must pick up with your courier. Left-click your courier. Right-click the present box.
