Chess Pieces, How They Combo, What Makes Them Tick

Shameless plug for [Dota Auto Chess Tool](http://dota.wassuh.com). Try out combos yourself!

## Combining Pieces

Combining 3 of the same piece will make it a ★★ piece.

Combining 3 ★★ pieces will make it ★★★ piece, super saiyan mode. 

Io is a 5 cost piece that can be used as a substitute in place of other chess piece for upgrading.

## Piece Availability

The Chess Pool is shared for all players. Each tier has a different amount of units available.

| Cost         | Amount |
| ------------- |---------------:|
| 1             | 45              |
| 2             | 30              |
| 3             | 25              |
| 4             | 15              |
| 5             | 10              |

The chance of rolling rarer pieces is linked to your level. You can see the percentages in-game by selecting your courier and hovering over the **D** ability.

The Shop can be opened and closed any time with **SPACEBAR**, or by clicking the **Chess Pieces** icon in the top-left. 

The Shop re-rolls every round, unless you press the Lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Buy Chess Pieces menu.

### The Blacklist *Advanced Topic*

Whenever a chess piece is to be replaced by a new one (either by manually re-rolling or the natural re-roll after a round), all chess pieces that were still in the shop are added to list of pieces that cannot occur in the next pack. This list is completely renewed on every re-roll, so previous blacklists have no effect.
