## PVP Rounds

Fight other players. You want your beefcakes in the front and range dps in the back.

Chance to get items. It is **very important** to win these rounds.

| 20            | Hellbears             |
| 25            | Wildwings             | Ranged Splash Area Effect. Spread 'em
| 30            | Thunderhides          | They Ignore Armor. Move CC forward
| 35            | **Black Dragon****    | **Spread 'em.**
| 40            | Trolls                | Move all the way forward

| 50            | Roshan                | Don't worry about this

***\*The most important round you need to remember.** Round 15 wolves act like assassin pieces and jump to the back line at the start of the fight. A common strategy to counter this is to move your ranged and caster units to the top of your board.*

***The Black Dragon does splash damage and you should to spread your units.*

Most games end before Trolls at Round 40.

## Gold

Your currency is shown in the top-right of the screen. 

At the end of each round you recieve:

| Round         | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Gold  |
| ------------- |-----:|
| 1             | 1     |
| 2             | 2     |
| 3             | 3     |
| 4             | 4     |
| 5+            | 5     |

You recieve an extra gold for winning in PVP rounds.

## Interest

Interest accumulates at 10% per round. 

It rounds down and **caps at 50 gold for 5 interest per round**.

## Spending

There are 3 ways to spend your currency:
### Buying Pieces - 1-5 gold

For the first several rounds you want to purchase multiple copies to combine and combinations of species and class.

Pieces sell back for 100% of their value. You can buy pieces and hold them for a round at no loss as long as it doesn't take you below an interest level.

### Manually Re-Rolling the Shop - 2 gold

This should be done sparingly. 2 Gold per reroll adds up quickly and you need to save gold for interest.

### Buying Experience - 5 gold

Buying experience gives you **4 experience**. 

Your couriers level is displayed in the bottom left of its portrait, in the bottom left of your screen.

*If you hold **ALT** you can see the experience as a number.*


## Streak Bonuses

PVE rounds **do not** count towards your streak.

| Win/Loss⠀⠀⠀⠀      | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Bonus Gold |
| ------------- |-----:|
| 3-5           | 1     |
| 6-8           | 2     |
| 9+            | 3     |
