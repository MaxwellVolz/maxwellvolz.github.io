title: Dota Underlords Part 1
---

I've played a few games and I won one so you could say I'm an expert already.


## Game Overview

Players assemble a team of units to battle against each other in a series of rounds. Each round players add to their team while trying to find combinations of similar pieces **and** pieces with matching species and classes. 

After assembling chess pieces on their chess board they fight against either a set of neutral creeps for a chance at loot or copies of a random opponents team.

Basics:
 - Each player starts with 100% life
 - You lose life by losing rounds on your own board
 - Rounds consist of PVP and PVE battles
 - Draws and wins do not lead to losing life
 - Once a player reaches 0% they are eliminated
 - As you gain levels you can have more pieces in play
 - Combining 3 of the same piece will make it a ★★ piece
 - Combining 3 ★★ pieces will make it ★★★ piece, super saiyan mode

 ## The Game

The game begins with a single choice of 5 units from Tier 1.

You want to start looking from combinations of **Alliances**. Alliances consist of unique pieces.

These are all of the Alliances currently in game:

Alliances may have different amounts of pieces required for the bonus tiers.

The **Brawny** Alliance only has 2 tiers that require 2 each.

## Items

The first 3 rounds are PVE and allow you to choose an item. Items can be equipped by your Pieces to increase their power, or passively affect your board in other ways.

The **Blight Stone** is most useful when equipped on a strong physical damage Piece.

**Unstable Reactor** passively affects your **Inventor** Pieces.

## Getting Started

I recommend playing at practice round against **Solo/Bot**. 

This will allow you to progress through the rounds at your own pace.

Or just speed through the screenshots below **and pop into a Multiplayer**.

## Round 1

When the game begins you will see the following screen with a random set of 5 units from Tier 1.
