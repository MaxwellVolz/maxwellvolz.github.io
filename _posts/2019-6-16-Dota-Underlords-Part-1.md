Dota Underlords is a strategy game where players purchase units each turn in hopes of combining them into stronger versions to build an army that fights for them to crush seven other opponents.


## Game Overview

Players assemble a team of units to battle against each other over a series of rounds. Each round players add to their team while trying to find combinations of similar pieces and pieces with matching species and classes called **Alliances**. 

After assembling chess pieces on their chess board they fight against either a set of neutral creeps for a chance at loot or copies of a random opponents team.

Basics:
 - Each player starts with 100% life
 - You lose life by losing rounds
 - Rounds consist of PVP and PVE battles
 - Draws and wins do not lead to losing life
 - Once a player reaches 0% they are eliminated
 - As you gain levels you can have more pieces in play
 - Combining 3 multiples make

## The Game

The game begins with a single choice of 5 units from Tier 1.

You want to start looking from combinations of **Alliances**. 

**Alliances** only count unique pieces but duplicate pieces will also recieve the bonus if applicable.

These are currently 23 **Alliances** in the game:

**Alliances** may have different amounts of pieces required for the bonus tiers. 

The **Brawny Alliance** has two tiers that require two each and each tier increased the HP of your **Brawny** pieces.

The **Assassin Alliance** has three tiers of three that each give bonus chances for to attack for critical damage for **Assassins**.

## Items

The first 3 rounds are PVE and allow you to choose an item. Items can be equipped by your Pieces to increase their power, or passively affect your board in other ways.

The **Blight Stone** is most useful when equipped on a strong physical damage Piece.

**Unstable Reactor** passively affects your **Inventor** Pieces.

## Getting Started

I recommend playing at practice round against **Solo/Bot**. 

This will allow you to progress through the rounds at your own pace.

Or just speed through the screenshots below **and pop into a Multiplayer**.

## Round 1

When the game begins you will see the following screen with a random set of 5 units from Tier 1.

## Breakdown of UI

![UnderlordsUIBreakdown1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/uibreakdown1.png)

- **Guide** - Opens in-game guide to Pieces, Alliances, and Items
- **Lock** - Prevents *The Shop* from automatically rerolling at the start of the round. Can be used if you're too poor to purchase a combo you want.
- **Cost** - Higher tier Pieces cost more but have higher base stats. 
- **Reroll** - 2 gold allows you to manually reroll *The Shop*
- **Buy XP** - 5 gold gives you 4xp. This is important to notice when purchasing XP will get you to the next level and allow another piece on the board. 
- **Alliance Icons** - Displays Alliances of options in *The Shop*


As you add more Pieces to your Board and Bench the **Alliance Icons** will also show you what Alliances you are working towards.

As an example I've purchased **Enchantress**.

Enchantress is a **Savage** and a **Druid** and because I now have 1 of 2 **Savage** pieces the Tusk Piece in the Shop shows my progress towards that combo.

## The Final Step Before Battle

Drag the Piece you purchased from *The Bench* onto *The Board*.

## Battle

![UnderlordsWarmupRound]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/warmupround.png)

## Item Selection

At the end of a **Loot Round** you to choose from a selection of 3* items.

**This can be increased to 4 with a passive item.*

## More UI Breakdown

The right side of your screen consists of 3 menus that can be navigate by clicking the icons or using your mouse wheel.

The First Menu displays **Alliances**. With an Enchantress on *The Board* this menu shows one of two **Savage** and one of two **Druids**.

![UnderlordsUIBreakdown2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/uibreakdown2.png)

When the round begins the Second Menu displays several tables to compare the DPS, Damage Taken, and other useful stats about the battle. This is useful for seeing the effectiveness of your Pieces on *The Board*.

The Third Menu displays your current items. You can equip active items by dragging them onto a Piece.

## Scoreboard Breakdown

- **Gold** - A good way of judging if you can afford rerolls or should be saving for interest gains.
- **Level** - Determines amount of Pieces you can have on *The Board* and chances for rolling higher tier Pieces. Experience increases by 1 each round and 4xp can be purchased for 5 gold. 
- **Health** - Players position will update as the lose health. Don't run out!
