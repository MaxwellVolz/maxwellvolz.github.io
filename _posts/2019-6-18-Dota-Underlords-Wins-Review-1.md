Check out the Demon Hunters Passive Item and my reviews of some of my winning team compositions.

## Strange Bedfellows

Weird name...but sweet passive item.

![UnderlordsDemonsPassive]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/demonsPassive.png)

I picked up this **Demon Hunters** passive item in round 2 and started focussing on gathering both **Demon Hunters**, and then as many **Demons** as possible.

The bonus makes your **Demon Hunters** hit like trucks. **+30% for each unique allied Demon unit**.

At the time of the screenshot my **Terrorblade** and **Anti Mage**(mostly covered by the item overly) are getting **+120% Pure Damage**.

While this was a really fun team to play I failed to make enough combos to win and finished 2nd.

On to some recent wins!

# Beast and Druids with a sprinkling of Human

## The Druids

Druids are just fun to play. If you ever get a two star druid you can pick up any other druid and if you play it...**BAM**...it's also 2 star. 

**The 2 set druid combo increases the level of the lowest druid on the board. If you have two 2 star druids one will become a 3 star.*

**The 4 set druid combo increases the level of the lowest 2 druids on the board. If you have two 2 star druids both will become 3 star.*

Having a level 3 **Enchantress** and level 2 **Prophet**, **Treant**, and **Lone Druid** meant that two my level 2's would become level 3. Very strong.

## The Beasts

This team benefitted from the fact that **Enchantress** and **Lone Druid** are both Druid *and* Beast. Double combo beats single combo.

Having a level 2 **Lycan** (*he summons 2 wolves*) plus the summons from **Furion** helped with the fact that I had no real tank combos.

## The Humans

**Lycan** also helped to make our Human combo. This is a low priority combo. The real reason we have **Kunkka** is for the boat.

## The Fights

Most fights went like this. 

**Tidehunter** *the combo'd* placed at the front blasts his ult and stuns their whole team.

**Kunkka** calls in the almighty ship of death as a perfect follow up stun.

**Sand King** throws in an unnecessary line stun on the remaining alive.

**Lone Druid**, **Furion**, and **Lycan** all cast summons increasing our amount of units on the board by 4 unnecessarily.

**Timbersaw** does his attack on a bunch of dead enemies.

*Game Over*

# Hunters and Warriors and Nagas Oh My!


## Hunters

The first 3 rounds are PVE and allow you to choose an item. Items can be equipped by your Pieces to increase their power, or passively affect your board in other ways.

![UnderlordsItems1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items.png)

The **Blight Stone** is most useful when equipped on a strong physical damage Piece.

![UnderlordsItemActive]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/active.png)

**Unstable Reactor** passively affects your **Inventor** Pieces. 

![UnderlordsItemPassive]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/passive.png)


## Getting Started

I recommend playing at practice round against **Solo/Bot**. 

This will allow you to progress through the rounds at your own pace.

![UnderlordsSelectMode]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/selectMode.png)

Or just speed through the screenshots below **and pop into a Multiplayer**.

## Round 1

When the game begins you will see the following screen with a random set of 5 units from Tier 1.

![UnderlordsRound1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/round1.png)

## Breakdown of UI

![UnderlordsUIBreakdown1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/uibreakdown1.png)

- **Guide** - Opens in-game guide to Pieces, Alliances, and Items
- **Lock** - Prevents *The Shop* from automatically rerolling at the start of the round. Can be used if you're too poor to purchase a combo you want.
- **Cost** - Higher tier Pieces cost more but have higher base stats. 
- **Reroll** - 2 gold allows you to manually reroll *The Shop*
- **Buy XP** - 5 gold gives you 4xp. This is important to notice when purchasing XP will get you to the next level and allow another piece on the board. 
- **Alliance Icons** - Displays Alliances of options in *The Shop*


As you add more Pieces to your Board and Bench the **Alliance Icons** will also show you what Alliances you are working towards.

As an example I've purchased **Enchantress**.

![UnderlordsEnchantress]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/enchantress.png)

Enchantress is a **Savage** and a **Druid** and because I now have 1 of 2 **Savage** pieces the Tusk Piece in the Shop shows my progress towards that combo.

## The Final Step Before Battle

Drag the Piece you purchased from *The Bench* onto *The Board*.

![UnderlordsPlacePiece]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/placing.gif)

## Battle

![UnderlordsWarmupRound]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/warmupround.png)

## Item Selection

At the end of a **Loot Round** you to choose from a selection of 3* items.

**This can be increased to 4 with a passive item.*

![UnderlordsItemSelection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/itemSelection.png)

## More UI Breakdown

The right side of your screen consists of 3 menus that can be navigate by clicking the icons or using your mouse wheel.

The First Menu displays **Alliances**. With an Enchantress on *The Board* this menu shows one of two **Savage** and one of two **Druids**.

![UnderlordsUIBreakdown2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/uibreakdown2.png)

When the round begins the Second Menu displays several tables to compare the DPS, Damage Taken, and other useful stats about the battle. This is useful for seeing the effectiveness of your Pieces on *The Board*.

![UnderlordsUIBreakdownDPS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/dps.png)

The Third Menu displays your current items. You can equip active items by dragging them onto a Piece.

![UnderlordsPlacingItem]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/placingItem.gif)


## Scoreboard Breakdown

- **Gold** - A good way of judging if you can afford rerolls or should be saving for interest gains.
- **Level** - Determines amount of Pieces you can have on *The Board* and chances for rolling higher tier Pieces. Experience increases by 1 each round and 4xp can be purchased for 5 gold. 
- **Health** - Players position will update as the lose health. Don't run out!

Rinse. Repeat. Make a lot of combos.

More soon!
