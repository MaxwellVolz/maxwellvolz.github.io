A short dive into Loot Rounds and Gold.


## Loot Rounds

If you lose a Loot Round you do not lose health **but** the amount of items you get to choose from will be reduced. It is **very important** to win these rounds.

| Round⠀⠀⠀         |Type⠀⠀⠀  | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Strategy |
| ------------- |:---------------------|----------------------:|
| 1-3           | Normal Creeps         |
| 10            | Golems                |
| **15**        | **Wolves***           | **Put Tanks in Back. Reversio.**
| 20            | Hellbears             |
| 25            | Wildwings             | Ranged Splash Area Effect. Spread 'em
| 30            | Thunderhides          | They Ignore Armor. Move CC forward
| 35            | **Black Dragon****    | **Spread 'em.**
| 40            | Trolls                | Move all the way forward
| 45            | Lunar Beast           | Spread 'em
| 50            | Roshan                | Don't worry about this

*Round 15 - Wolves act like **Assassins** and jump to the back line at the start of the fight. A common strategy to counter this is to move your ranged and caster units to the top of your board. This is the most important round to adjust your board.*



## Gold

The currency of Underlords. Can be used to purchase experience and outpace your opponents with good management. Don't fall for the noob trap of rerolling at low levels for pieces you will be replacing later.

### Winning Bonus
At the end of a round you can recieve a bonus +1 gold for defeating another player on your board.

### Round Bonus

Before the pieces in the shop reroll you get additional income:

Round Bonus + Interest + Streak

| Round         | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Bonus Gold  |
| ------------- |-----:|
| 1             | +1     |
| 2             | +2     |
| 3             | +3     |
| 4             | +4     |
| 5+            | +5     |

### Interest

Interest is accrued at 10% per rounded down and calculated **after** your potential win bonus. Caps at +5 gold(50).

### Streaking

Loot Rounds **do not** count towards your streak. Sometimes it can be worth investing in experience to try to keep your streak alive.

| Win/Loss⠀⠀⠀⠀      | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Bonus Gold |
| ------------- |-----:|
| 3-5           | 1     |
| 6-8           | 2     |
| 9+            | 3     |


### A solid strategy is to start making serious moves to get to 50 gold starting ~Round 10-12

Once you've reached the interest cap of 50 gold you can start focussing on leveling up or cross your fingers and reroll.

I recommend getting to level 8 or 9 before you really start rerolling. Certain compositions that do not rely on 5-cost pieces may be able to effectively reroll earlier but generally having more pieces on the board is the winning strategy.
