Tier 1 Items Review and Strategy

![UnderlordsTier1Items]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/tier1items.png)

Before we hop in to review each individual item lets take a second to review how **you** will be evaluating these yourself in-game.

## The Damage Tab

In this tab you can easily see which of your pieces are doing the most damage. Some items are very straightforward in that you give them to your best performing unit. 

In the example below I have **four trolls** and gave a Maelstrom to Troll Warlord. He attacks extremely fast and the 25% chance to chain lighting is putting out 60% of his damage.

Damage from items is shown as Dark Blue and damage from spells is shown as Light Blue.

*On to the items!*

## Blight Stone
![UnderlordsBlightStone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/blightstone.png)

Low DPS increase that can be useful in early rounds on an **Assassin** or other high attack damage pieces. Good against **Warrior** teams. 

## Brooch
![UnderlordsBrooch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/brooch.png)

One of the best items from Tier 1. 

This item is useful early on any caster. I prefer putting it on Enchantress as it can make her near unkillable in the early rounds.

In later rounds this item can turn the tide in your favor on Tidehunter or Kunkka to insure they get their spell off before dying.

## Chainmail
![UnderlordsChainmail]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/chainmail.png)

Basic defense increase. 10 armor is actually a significant amount and can really bolster your front line.

## Claymore
![UnderlordsClaymore]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/claymore.png)

Basic damage increase. Enough damage to make a serious difference on Assassins and anything with critical chance(Lycan in form). 

## Cloak
![UnderlordsCloak]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/cloak.png)

Slight magic defense increase. Can be noticable for keeping your tanks alive against caster heavy teams.

## Riches
![UnderlordsRiches]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/riches.png)

If I get the chance to take this item on Round 1 or 2 I do. Usually take it on Round 3 as well unless there is a Brooch or I'm feeling Demons...

## Gloves
![UnderlordsGloves]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/gloves.png)

Basic damage increase. Doesn't seem that great. 

## Soul Sucking Syphon
![UnderlordsSyphon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/syphon.png)

I always think this item is going to be huge and can never really tell if it is. Seems to have only gotten better with the improved Knights AI. 

I like to surround my Necrophos with Knights even when I don't have this.


## Strange Bedfellows
![UnderlordsBedfellows]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/bedfellows.png)

You. Are. The. Demons. Super fun item that encourages the rarely seen full Demon build. Highly recommend trying this one out in your next game.

## Tranquil Boots
![UnderlordsBoots]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/boots.png)

Haven't used yet. Would be useful on Axe the Slug. +16 Health Regen seems high.

## Unstable Reactor
![UnderlordsReactor]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/reactor.png)

Haven't used effectively yet. I've had a hard time getting Goblin / Inventors rolling but this item is fun at early stages. A well-placed 
★★ Timbersaw can wipe a low level team on death.

## Vitality Booster
![UnderlordsBooster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/underlords/items/booster.png)

Basic defense increase. When your tank has this he gets his cast off every time...most of the time? Some of the time. It's alright.
