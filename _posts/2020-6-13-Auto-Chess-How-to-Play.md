The first three rounds are against tree creatures of increasing difficulty.

### PVE rounds are important to win because killing creatures in these rounds gives a chance to drop items.

Items appear as present boxes you must pick up with your courier.

They will appear in the inventory of your courier. You can hover over an item to read its effects. 

*Advanced Tip: Right-clicking an item will allow you to view what items it can combine with to make more powerful items*

As your courier levels up you can place more pieces on the chess board.
