# Patch Cliff Notes

## Gameplay Changes

> New opponent selection logic: This addresses the community feedback of fighting the same opponents over and over.

Nice! Hopefully this will prevent being repeatedly stomped by the #1 dude while floundering in last place. ;)

## Chess Piece Changes

### Big Dragon Buff

Before Patch: Dragons were pretty weak due to the rarity of getting all three. Plus the bonus sucked. Puck was the most useful Dragon due to having Elf+Mage and a useful spell.

> Dragon Alliance: Now requires 2 units.

> Dragon Alliance: Now Unlocks an additional ability for each member of the Alliance.

After Patch: Dragons look AMAZING! Expect to see them in every game. 

Dragon Knight now has Breathe Fire and +10 health regen by default and unlocks **Dragon Form** with the **Dragon Alliance**.

Puck gets Phase Shift and Viper gets Corrosive Skin with the **Dragon Alliance**.

### Scrappy Bonus

Interesting buff that could make **Scrappy** a very strong comp for focussing on economy. 

> Scrappy Alliance: Now provides 8 armor and 9 health regeneration. It provides double that amount if your starting army is smaller in size than your opponent's.

### Chaos Knumbers

Changes to some of his damage ranges. Cannot believe they made him stronger at â˜…. *Easy pickup for wins in early rounds.*

> Chaos Knight: Damage Increased from [40-110, 80-220, 160-440] to [55-135, 110-240, 200-480].


### KoTL Nerf

The White Knight gets blasted by the nerf bat. Definitely hurts the turtle-mage comp that has been gaining popularity. 

>Keeper of the Light: Illuminate now costs 150 mana.

>Keeper of the Light: Health decreased to 550/1100/2200.

### More Buffs for Dragon Knight

Why not? lol. He's going to be top played this patch.

> Knight Alliance: Now gives a constant 15/25/35% damage reduction and an additional 20/25/30% when next to another knight.

## Item Updates


### Less Useless Boots

>Boots of Speed: Now Tranquil Boots. Passive +16 health regen and 100% bonus move speed.

### Mortal Strike Buff

Seems to counter some of the added HP regen in this patch.

> Wicked Intent: Now also blocks HP regen.

### Pipe of Insight

Another blow to mages but not as big of a deal as this is definitely an endgame item. 

> New Item - Pipe of Insight: +50% Magic Resistance. Once the first enemy has 100% mana, apply a shield that blocks 400 magic damage to allies up to 1 cell away. (once per battle)

### Another Tier 5 Item Update

> Desperate Measure: Now also increases mana gained on receving/dealing damage by the same amount as attack damage.

Whatever. I haven't seen this yet.
